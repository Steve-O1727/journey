# journey
This is a journal of my journey to switch industries from Outside Sales and Business Account Management in non-IT to Systems & Network Administrator first and then Cybersecurity Analyst / Ethical Hacker next.

Pre-2000; I got re-excited about IT work, and wanted to make a jump. Being 50s years old, to re-invent oneself is always a journey.
